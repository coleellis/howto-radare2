# Information: The `i` Module

We use the `i` module to print out information from the binary. There are several submodules in this binary with various functionality; we will only cover the most important and commonly-used ones.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use `i?` to access the help page for the `i` module. This shows all the submodules and their descriptions.
{% endhint %}

Nearly all this information can be collected outside the binary using `rabin2`, a subpackage of `radare2`. When applicable, these commands are also displayed.
